# Word guesser

Welcome to my JavaScript project! This project is a combination of the classic games Wordle and Hangman with a twist.

My project allows users to guess the letters in a secret word, with the added challenge of a limited number of incorrect guesses. As the user guesses correctly, the secret word is revealed letter by letter.

There are still some unimplemented features that are being worked on, including:

- Adding more words to the game
- Altering the appearance of the guesses
- Changing the style of the game

## Rules

To play the game, simply press play and enter your guess in the designated text field and press the 'Guess' button. If your guess is correct, the corresponding letters in the secret word will be revealed. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose one of your remaining guesses (5 guesses max).

The game is won when the entire secret word is revealed, and it is lost when the number of remaining guesses reaches zero.
